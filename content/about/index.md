I'm Radu Bahmata, a testing engineer and security researcher who finds genuine joy in breaking protocols and challenging assumptions. My tech journey began with exploring various domains before discovering my true calling in testing and security research. This evolution taught me that understanding systems from multiple angles is essential, and I've since pioneered advanced testing techniques - fuzzing, property testing, and exploitation methods that reveal critical flaws before they can be weaponized.

## What Drives Me

My happiness comes from the moment a well-crafted test case reveals a hidden flaw. Every vulnerability I discover is a potential disaster prevented. Knowing I've protected systems from real exploits isn't just my work - it's what drives me.

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not breaking things professionally, you'll find me studying the craft - from security research to clean code principles - or spending quality time with my wife and kid. Balance is essential - the mind that can break systems also needs time to recharge and connect with what matters most.

## Let's Connect

If you're working on something interesting in testing, security research, vulnerability discovery, or advanced testing techniques, I'd love to hear about it. The best breakthroughs happen when minds collaborate.
