I'm Radu Bahmata, a software engineer and security researcher specialized in blockchain protocols. My tech journey began with exploring different areas before finding my focus in testing and security research. Currently, I work on the Stacks blockchain, where I build automated testing tools and sustain ongoing security efforts that help support the network's security goals. I'm a need-driven programmer - the tools I create come from real needs I encounter in my work.

## What I Work On

I focus on building testing infrastructure and sustaining security efforts, including:

- **Proof of Transfer (PoX)** - Tested Stacks' consensus mechanism
- **sBTC** - Used the testing tools I've built to test sBTC
- **Stacks Node** - Ongoing security testing and tooling work for the Stacks node
- **Exploit Patterns** - Extract exploit patterns and integrate them in the daily testing routine
- **Security Research** - Use the tools I build to help achieve the network's security goals

I work with advanced testing techniques including property-based testing, fuzzing, and systematic vulnerability discovery.

## What Drives Me

My happiness comes from the moment a well-crafted test case reveals a hidden flaw. Every vulnerability I discover is a potential disaster prevented. Knowing I've protected systems from real exploits isn't just my work - it's what drives me.

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not breaking things professionally, you'll find me studying the craft - from security research to clean code principles - or spending quality time with my wife and kid. Balance is essential - the mind that can break systems also needs time to recharge and connect with what matters most.

## Let's Connect

If you're working on blockchain security, testing frameworks, or vulnerability research, I'd love to hear about it. The best breakthroughs happen when minds collaborate.
