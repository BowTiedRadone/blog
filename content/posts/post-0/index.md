One of the first lessons that stuck with me came from an unexpected place - the concept of ice-breaker tests. Small progress beats no progress, every single time.

## What's an Ice-Breaker Test?

It's that basic test you write just to prove your setup works. Nothing fancy - maybe checking if a function returns the expected type, or if your test runner can find your test files.

The best idea is always to write simple ice-breaker tests first, because there's always work involved in getting everything up and running.

## My First Security Research Story

When I started fuzzing blockchain protocols, I felt intimidated by the complexity. Reading academic research about advanced testing techniques made me think I needed to find sophisticated attack vectors from day one.

**I was wrong.**

My breakthrough came soon after - starting with embarrassingly simple tests instead of hunting for complex exploits. Those simple tests evolved into a complex stateful property testing setup that found three interesting bugs in the target protocol. More on this in future posts.

## Small Progress > No Progress

The ice-breaker principle became my mantra: **small progress beats no progress**. Whether you're researching a new fuzzing framework, exercising a smart contract, or setting up some property tests - start simple. Get your environment working. Prove you can run a basic test. Then iterate.

The most sophisticated discoveries often start from the simplest tests.

## This Post Is My Ice-Breaker Test

Speaking of ice-breakers - this post is exactly that for my blog. Instead of launching with complex technical deep-dives, I'm starting with a simple concept anyone can apply immediately.

Just like those simple tests, this post gets my writing setup working. It proves I can publish something, get feedback, and iterate from there.

The craft reveals itself one small step at a time.
